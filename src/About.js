      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        With over five years in childcare, I currently work in a vibrant toddler
        room at a local nursery. Certified with a DBS check and first aid
        training, I'm actively pursuing my Level 3 in childcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've cared for children of all ages, from babies to teenagers, bringing
        a wealth of experience and adaptability to the table. Holding a dance
        degree, I've not only integrated movement into my caregiving but also
        taught dance in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Committed to creating a safe, fun, and nurturing environment, I look
        forward to the opportunity to care for and inspire your little ones.
        Thank you for considering me as your trusted babysitter!
